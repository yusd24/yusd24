	abstract = {The presented paper is a continuation of the series of papers arXiv:1810.00606 and arXiv:1903.09373. In this paper, utilizing Batyrev and Borisov's duality construction on nef-partitions, we generalize the recipe in arXiv:1810.00606 and arXiv:1903.09373 to construct a pair of singular double cover Calabi--Yau varieties $(Y,Y^{\vee})$ over toric manifolds and compute their topological Euler characteristics and Hodge numbers. In the $3$-dimensional cases, we show that $(Y,Y^{\vee})$ forms a topological mirror pair, i.e., $h^{p,q}(Y)=h^{3-p,q}(Y^{\vee})$ for all $p,q$.},

@preprint{2023-Lee-Lian-Romo-non-commutative-resolutions-as-mirrors-of-singular-calabi-yau-varieties,
	abstract = {It has been conjectured that the hemisphere partition function arXiv:1308.2217, arXiv:1308.2438 in a gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) computes the central charge arXiv:math/0212237 of an object in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves for Calabi--Yau (CY) manifolds. There is also evidence in arXiv:alg-geom/ 9511001, arXiv:hep-th/0007071. On the other hand, non-commutative resolutions of singular CY varieties have been studied in the context of abelian GLSMs arXiv:0709.3855. In this paper, we study an analogous construction of abelian GLSMs for non-commutative resolutions and propose they can be used to study a class of recently discovered mirror pairs of singular CY varieties. Our main result shows that the hemisphere partition functions (a.k.a.~$A$-periods) in the new GLSM are in fact period integrals (a.k.a.~$B$-periods) of the singular CY varieties. We conjecture that the two are completely equivalent: $B$-periods are the same as $A$-periods. We give some examples to support this conjecture and formulate some expected homological mirror symmetry (HMS) relation between the GLSM theory and the CY. As shown in arXiv:2003.07148, the $B$-periods in this case are precisely given by a certain fractional version of the $B$-series of arXiv:alg-geom/9511001. Since a hemisphere partition function is defined as a contour integral in a cone in the complexified secondary fan (or FI-theta parameter space) arXiv:1308.2438, it can be reduced to a sum of residues (by theorems of Passare-Tsikh-Zhdanov and Tsikh-Zhdanov). Our conjecture shows that this residue sum may now be amenable to computations in terms of the $B$-series.},
