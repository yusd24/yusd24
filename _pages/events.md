## **2024 TIMS Summer Program in Geometry**
###### **Venue**: R202, Astronomy Mathematics Bldg., NTU
###### **Date**: 7/10-7/20
###### **Aim and Scope**:

Singularity appears in numerous branches of mathematics and physics; it provides information to bridge two different models as well as geometry on them. One of the most important examples is the conifold transition, where the singularities are ordinary double points, and it plays a vital role in understanding the moduli spaces of Calabi--Yau threefolds. The 2024 TIMS Summer Program aims to bring together scholars in related areas and provide an opportunity to exchange ideas and share insights. This year, we will be focusing on recent developments of differential geometry, algebraic geometry, as well as quantum geometry related to conifold transitions and beyond, from both mathematical and physical aspects. This summer program includes a summer school and a workshop; it will take place from 7/10 to 7/20 at National Taiwan University.

###### **Organizers**
 - Wu-yen Chuang (NTU & TIMS)
 - Tsung-Ju Lee (NCKU)
 - Chin-Lung Wang (NTU & TIMS)

###### **Sponsor**
 - Taida Institute for Mathematical Sciences (TIMS)
